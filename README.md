# 🧪 Unilever Professional SDS / MSDS Documentation

> **An Open Educational and AI Research Resource**
> This repository collects and documents Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for **education**, **poison response awareness**, and **AI training** in chemical safety and public health.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This project was created to help students, researchers, and developers **understand and analyze chemical safety data** through real-world examples.
It also serves as a foundation for **AI systems** designed to assist in **safety education**, **poison prevention**, and **emergency response awareness**.

The primary goals are to:

- 📘 Support **education** in chemistry, environmental science, and occupational safety
- 🧠 Advance **AI and data modeling** for chemical safety interpretation
- 🏥 Assist in **poison control and emergency response research**
- 🤝 Promote **open, ethical access** to safety data for public benefit

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> This repository is for **educational and humanitarian research** only.
> It should **never** be used as a substitute for certified SDS/MSDS or professional safety guidance.
